# 🌐 Portfolio Website – Assignment 1

## 📖 Project Description
This is a personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of Assignment 1.  
The site showcases my background, projects, and achievements with a modern responsive design and dark mode support.  
It follows the assignment requirement of having at least three sections (**About Me**, **Projects**, **Contact**) and includes extra sections (**Experience, Skills, Awards**) for a complete professional profile.

## ✨ Features
- **About Me** → 2–3 sentence introduction with profile image and highlights.  
- **Projects** → At least 2 showcased projects with titles, descriptions, and placeholder images.  
- **Contact** → Simple form with Name, Email, and Message (front-end only, no backend).  
- **Extra Sections** → Experience & Education timeline, Skills & Expertise, and Awards & Recognition.  
- **Dark Mode** → Auto-detects system theme, with manual toggle option.  
- **Responsive Layout** → Mobile-first, adapts to tablets and desktops.  
- **Modern Styling** → Apple-inspired design with overlays, gradients, and minimal cards.
