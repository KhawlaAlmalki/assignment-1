# 🌐 Portfolio Website – Assignment 1

## 📖 Project Description
This is a personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of Assignment 1.  
The site showcases my background, projects, and achievements with a modern responsive design and dark mode support.  
It follows the assignment requirement of having at least three sections (**About Me**, **Projects**, **Contact**) and includes extra sections (**Experience, Skills, Awards**) for a complete professional profile.

## ✨ Features
- **About Me** → 2–3 sentence introduction with profile image and highlights.  
- **Projects** → At least 2 showcased projects with titles, descriptions, and placeholder images.  
- **Contact** → Simple form with Name, Email, and Message (front-end only, no backend).  
- **Extra Sections** → Experience & Education timeline, Skills & Expertise, and Awards & Recognition.  
- **Dark Mode** → Auto-detects system theme, with manual toggle option.  
- **Responsive Layout** → Mobile-first, adapts to tablets and desktops.  
- **Modern Styling** → Apple-inspired design with overlays, gradients, and minimal cards.

🤖 AI Usage Summary
Tools Used & Use Cases

ChatGPT (GPT-5): Assisted in generating starter code for HTML, CSS, and JS; suggested UI/UX improvements; explained Git workflow; and provided debugging help.

Placeholder image services (picsum.photos / placehold.co): Used temporary images for project cards until real screenshots are added.

Git & GitHub: Used for version control, handling commits, pushes, and merge conflicts.

Benefits

Accelerated development with structured starter code.

Learned new responsive CSS patterns and dark mode logic.

Gained design inspiration (hero overlays, clean typography, fade-in animations).

Challenges

Some AI suggestions used Linux commands (mkdir -p) that didn’t work in PowerShell; I had to adapt them.

AI sometimes produced too much code or over-engineered solutions; I simplified them to meet assignment scope.

Needed to ensure accessibility (contrast, readable text on images).

Learning Outcomes

Understood how to structure a static website project (HTML, CSS, JS, assets, docs).

Learned to implement dark mode using prefers-color-scheme and localStorage overrides.

Practiced using Git with remotes and handling merge conflicts.

Strengthened ability to review and adapt AI output responsibly.

Responsible Use

I did not copy blindly. I reviewed, tested, and modified all suggestions.

Content (About, Projects, Achievements) was rewritten to reflect my actual experiences.

Simplified or reorganized AI output where needed to ensure originality and clarity.

Used AI as an assistant and learning tool, not as a replacement for my own work.
